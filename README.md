# CS1004-crazy8
Final assignment for my intro to Java class, submitted April 3, 2023.
This project plays a command-line crazy 8s game. You play against a computer 
player who plays the first compatible card in their hand, or draws. 

To play this game, open your terminal and compile the CrazyEights.java file.

Watch out for some fun easter eggs. Enjoy!
